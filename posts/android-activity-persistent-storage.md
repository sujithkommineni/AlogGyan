This video explains the concept of persistent storage in Android and its importance in saving data permanently. We'll discuss different methods of persistent storage, including accessing the file system directly, using SQLite DB, and shared preferences.

Then, we'll see an example of how to use Shared Preferences. We'll see how to use different lifecycle methods of Activity to store and retrieve data from Shared Preferences.

Also, we'll see what the Android file system looks like using Android Studio Device Explorer. Later, we'll see how to use ADB (Android Debugging Bridge) to open the files stored in the file system.
